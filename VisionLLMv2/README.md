## 🏠 Overview

<img src='assets/arch.png' align="center" width="95%">

We present VisionLLM v2, an end-to-end generalist multimodal large model (MLLM) that unifies visual perception, understanding, and generation within a single framework. Unlike traditional MLLMs limited to text output, VisionLLM v2 significantly broadens its application scope. It excels not only in conventional visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing.


## ✨ Highlights

VisionLLM v2 
- supports using <b>textual, visual and in-context instructions</b> to accomplish <b>hundreds of vision-language tasks</b>, including mutlimodal conversation, object detection, instance segmentation, interactive segmentation, pose estimation, image generation and editing, *etc*. 
- shows strong generalization across <b>multiple domains</b> such as industry, medical and remote-sensing images. 
- achieves <b>comparable performance</b> with expert models on various standard benchmarks.
